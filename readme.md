# Welcome to the Data Science Repo

Hi! The purpose of this repo is to explore various Data Science & Machine Learning concepts. 
I will be regularly updating the repo with sample projects. Below you will find a brief description about each and the techniques implemented. 


# Projects

While learning about Data Science and Machine Learning I have implemented a few key concepts such as **Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Inferential Statistics, Linear Regression modelling and model assessment using R-squared values etc.** 

 1. **Bank Data Set** 
This project involves exploring the banking data set available via Kaggle to understand what kind of a customer the bank should offer a loan to. The dataset has been slightly modified through certain coursework requirements, however, for the purposes of pure Data Analytics & EDA.


2. **Telecom Churn** 
**Problem Statement**
You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:
    - Demographics (age, gender etc.)
    - Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
    - Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)

    Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.

3. **Lead Scoring Case Study**:
 **Problem Statement**
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted.
X Education wants it's Data Analyst team to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
The company requires its Data Analyst team to build a model wherein they need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

4. **EDA Credit Case Study**
**Problem Statement**
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants are capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

    **Objective**
    The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

5. **K-Means Clustering - Help International NGO**
HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. It runs a lot of operational projects from time to time along with advocacy drives to raise awareness as well as for funding purposes.
The CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid.
**Objective**:
Your job is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then you need to suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.

# Welcome to the Data Science Repo

Hi! The purpose of this repo is to explore various Data Science & Machine Learning concepts. 
I will be regularly updating the repo with sample projects. Below you will find a brief description about each and the techniques implemented. 


# Projects

While learning about Data Science and Machine Learning I have implemented a few key concepts such as **Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Inferential Statistics, Linear Regression modelling and model assessment using R-squared values etc.** 

 1. **Bank Data Set** 
This project involves exploring the banking data set available via Kaggle to understand what kind of a customer the bank should offer a loan to. The dataset has been slightly modified through certain coursework requirements, however, for the purposes of pure Data Analytics & EDA.

2. **Bank Data Set** 

3. **Telecom Churn Example** 
**Problem Statment**
You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:

Demographics (age, gender etc.)
Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)
 

Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.

# Welcome to the Data Science Repo

Hi! The purpose of this repo is to explore various Data Science & Machine Learning concepts. 
I will be regularly updating the repo with sample projects. Below you will find a brief description about each and the techniques implemented. 


# Projects

While learning about Data Science and Machine Learning I have implemented a few key concepts such as **Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Inferential Statistics, Linear Regression modelling and model assessment using R-squared values etc.** 

 1. **Bank Data Set** 
This project involves exploring the banking data set available via Kaggle to understand what kind of a customer the bank should offer a loan to. The dataset has been slightly modified through certain coursework requirements, however, for the purposes of pure Data Analytics & EDA.
